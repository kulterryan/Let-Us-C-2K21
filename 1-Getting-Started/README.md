# Solutions of CHAPTER 1: GETTING STARTED

## [A]

   REASON:- A character constant is a constant which uses single quotation around characters.
       
    Invalid:- '3.15' eLearning' 'Quest'
  
   REASON:- No Comma/Space in integer constant & No exponentiation operator available.
   
    Invalid:- "35,550" "2^3" "4 6 5 2"
   
  
## [B] 
REASON:- No special symbol except underscore allowed in variable naming
    
       B'day $hello  #HASH _main() total% %name% stack-queue	
    
REASON:- Keyword cannot be used as a variable.

    	int
REASON:- Variable name should start with an alphabet.
    	
    	Same as 1st

## [E] 
    
    (a) Statement Terminator is missing, and it couldn't be figured out whether the expression is (a+b)*(b-35)
    
       or a+(b*b)-35 because of unavailability of parentheses.
    
    (b) Nesting of comments is not allowed.
    
    (c) "&" Operator is Missing.
    
    (d) Statement terminator operator ";" is missing in integer declaration and scanf & printf functions.
